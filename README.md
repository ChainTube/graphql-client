# ChainTube streamer
A simple GraphQL client for unit tests.

Forked from [gqlgen client](https://github.com/99designs/gqlgen) with a fix to unmarshal to
user-defined structs (the testing client doesn't respect the server-side unmarshal functions, see [this issue](https://github.com/99designs/gqlgen/issues/2344)).
